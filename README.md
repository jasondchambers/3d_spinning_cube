# 3d_spinning_cube
A Java port and a Python port of the "Code-It-Yourself! 3D Graphics Engine Part #1 - Triangles & Projection" From [@javidx9.](https://twitter.com/javidx9)

The link to the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU
 
I've also extended the Python port to incorporate lighting - see Part 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgMWc6LumG4

If you are interested in learning 3D graphics, javidx9's videos are very approachable.
This code is not optimized - it is for educational purposes only. There are optimizations
(for example, collapsing the matrix multiplications into one) that are intentionally left
out to enable the student to step through.
 
I wrote this code in Java because I don't run Windows at home (just Mac and Linux). I have nothing
against Windows or C++ - I was just too lazy to spin up a virtual Windows machine. I went with Java
not because Java is my favourite language (it isn't), but because I wanted to play around with some 
of the more recent language features (e.g. Record). Also, Java is widely used in both education and
industry. The intent of this exercise was to focus on the foundational math and for the language,
frameworks and libraries to not get in the way.

I also wrote in Python using pygame because, well why not?
